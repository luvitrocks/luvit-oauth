# luvit-oauth

Simple [OAuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) API for [luvit.io](http://luvit.io) . It allows users to authenticate against providers and thus act as OAuth consumers.

Tested against Twitter (http://twitter.com) and Github (http://github.com).

Also provides rudimentary OAuth2 support, tested against github (in plans facebook, foursquare or google as well).

npm install luvit-oauth
```
